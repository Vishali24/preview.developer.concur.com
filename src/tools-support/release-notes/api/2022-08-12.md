# API Release Notes, August 2022

## New This Month

### Hotel Service v4 API Available

The Hotel Service v4 API will allow Custom Hotel Source (CHS) vendors to provide hotel inventory, rates and booking related functionality to users of the new SAP Concur Online Booking Tool (Travel Evolution).

Once the CHS provider has developed and certified their API implementation with SAP Concur, their content will be available to shop and book by opted-in Travel users.

### SSL Certificates for us.api.concursolutions.com and emea.api.concursolutions.com Expiring (Aug 15 2022)

To ensure the ongoing security of our products and services, the current SSL certificates for us.api.concursolutions.com and emea.api.concursolutions.com are being renewed. The current certificates will expire on August 15, 2022.

Users who have not pinned the SSL certificates do not need to take any action as the certificates will be renewed automatically. Most users do not pin the certificates.

Users who have pinned the expiring certificates must renew the certificates before August 11, 2022 6 PM PST. If the pinned certificates are not updated before August 11, 2022 6PM PST, connections to SAP Concur products through SAP integration with Concur Services (SAP ICS) and Web Services might be disrupted. Please consult with your IT department to confirm whether this applies to you.

NOTE: Because SSL certificates are renewed on a regular basis to ensure the security of our products, pinning them is not recommended.

### IP Address Range for Callouts

Beginning in August and continuing through the end of 2022, servers that support SAP Concur callouts in the US & EMEA datacenters will be upgraded. For more information on this release note, please see the August [Shared Release Notes](http://www.concurtraining.com/customers/tech_pubs/RN_shared_planned/_client_shared_RN_all.htm).
